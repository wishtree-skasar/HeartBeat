                        <p>
                            Brian has come a long way from his roots in building computers, coding, and designing
                            websites for extra spending money as a high schooler. Today, he’s a serial entrepreneur
                            who’s passionate about making big ideas become a reality through innovation and
                            collaboration. His inquisitive mind is constantly searching for ways to improve people’s
                            lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His idea for Heartbeat began In 2013 when he co-founded Wyldfire, the first
                            female-focused dating app designed to deliver a better and safer mobile experience for
                            women. Through the experience, he found how much power smaller influencers had in promoting
                            the dating app. He knew then and there that it was those kinds of voices he needed to
                            cultivate. Not too long after, in 2016, Heartbeat was born.
